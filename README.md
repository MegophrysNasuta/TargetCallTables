# TargetCallTables

Set up a prioritized list of enemy targets for raiding with easy aliases
to set several targets at once, as well as set and party call them in the
pre-configured order.

## Aliases

`st PlayerName`

- set your target to PlayerName and call it in pt

`st PlayerName1, PlayerName2, ..., [and ]PlayerNameN` (with or without commas)

- set this list (in order presented) to your prioritized list of targets

`st1`, `st2`, ..., `stN` (where N is some number)

- set your target to and party call the 1st, 2nd, or nth target (warning you if it does not exist)

`st1 PlayerName`, `st2 PlayerName`, ..., `stN PlayerName`

- set PlayerName to the indicated slot in the prioritized target list
